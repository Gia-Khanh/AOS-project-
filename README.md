## Optimizing Strategic Decisions for American Office Systems (AOS) Using Linear Programming"

## Introduction and Business Use Case 
American Office Systems, Inc., founded in 1939, initially sold office supplies and later expanded into small office equipment and copiers. Struggling to compete with larger brands, the company developed an innovative adapter in the 1990s that turns copiers into laser printers, scanners, and fax machines. Despite the product's potential, the company remains small and underfunded, receiving $15 million in 1994 for production. They are currently facing challenges in balancing production and marketing to grow the adapter’s market, with financial constraints and cash flow issues influencing their decisions.

### Objectives: 
  - Develop a Linear Programming (LP) model to optimize the allocation of funds between production and advertising for American Office Systems. The model incorporates cash flow, financial constraints, marketing impact, inventory management, and production considerations to 
    maximize profits using data and estimates from the executive team.

-  Adapter Pricing Sensitivity: assess how changes in adapter prices (increase or decrease) affect the profitability and optimal resource allocation in the LP solution. Provide insights  on the significance of price variations for IBM and Macintosh adapters.
-  Production Cost Sensitivity: evaluate the impact of errors in production cost estimates on profitability and the LP solution, ensuring the company can adjust strategies if costs deviate from assumptions.
- Accounts Receivable Management: analyze the financial and operational implications of adopting a new collection procedure or switching to an all-cash policy to alleviate cash flow constraints. Make recommendations based on the costs and benefits of each approach.
- Advertising Effectiveness: investigate the impact of over- or underestimating advertising effectiveness on the LP solution. Determine the implications for profit margins and resource allocation when advertising costs vary.
- Higher-Interest Credit Line: assess how a higher-interest credit line from a local bank affects cash flow, profitability, and the company’s financial strategy, given the failure to secure the original Citibank credit line.
- Inventory Safety Cushion: examine the effect of increasing the inventory safety cushion from 10% to 15% or 20% on operational costs, ensuring inventory management aligns with demand forecasts and minimizes disruptions.
-  Production Capacity Changes:
   (a) Analyze the impact of delaying the planned 10% production capacity increase until the following year on sales, inventory, and overall operations.
   (b) Assess the additional effects of a 10% production capacity decrease in the fourth quarter due to an accident, and how this affects the LP model's recommendations.
- Sales Forecast Accuracy: evaluate the potential impact of inaccuracies in sales forecasts on profitability and operations. Determine if investing $50,000 in a marketing research firm to improve forecast accuracy is justifiable.
